Insights from the Dashboard:<br>


More than 1 in 4 customers churn, making retention a critical business priority.<br>

The early customer lifecycle is the most fragile — onboarding experience matters more than long-term discounts.

Long-term contracts act as a natural churn shield.

Customers with no support-based services (Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection, TechSupport (~40%)) are far more likely to leave, indicating lack of perceived value.

Individual customers are more price-sensitive and less loyal.

A small percentage of customers drive a large portion of revenue risk.

Customer churn in the Telco dataset is driven by early tenure, short-term contracts, and lack of value-added services.

By targeting high-risk and high-value customers early, the business can significantly reduce revenue loss with focused retention strategies.



Conclusion:

Customer churn in the Telco dataset is driven by early tenure, short-term contracts, and lack of value-added services. By targeting high-risk and high-value customers early, the business can significantly reduce revenue loss with focused retention strategies.
